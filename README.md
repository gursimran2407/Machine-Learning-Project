# COMP6321-Machine-Learning

The goal of this project is to give students experience in the following aspects of applied machine learning:
collecting data sets that are given in diverse formats;
preparing data sets for training and testing;
training many types of classification and regression models; performing hyperparameter search for each type of model;
evaluating and summarizing classification and regression performance; generating plots that summarize performance;
different approaches to interpretability; and
writing about machine learning concepts, experiments, and results.
The specifics of these skills are not spelled out in the project guidelines, but rather something you should acquire by drawing upon lectures, labs, papers, lots of practice, and feedback from course staff.
